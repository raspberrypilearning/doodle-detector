Invent two alien words â€” a word that means "left" and a word that means "right".

Now you will record eight examples of each word so that your machine learning model can learn to recognise them.

--- task ---
+ Click on **+ Add new label** on the top right of the screen and add a label called `left`.
--- /task ---

--- task ---
+ Click on **+ Add example** inside the box for the new `left` label, and record yourself saying your alien word for "left". 

+ Repeat until you have recorded **at least eight examples**.

--- task ---
+ **+ Add new label** to create another label called `right` and record eight examples of your alien word for "right".
